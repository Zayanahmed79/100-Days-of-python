# 🐍 100 Days of Python (CodeWithHarry)

Welcome to my personal journey through the **100 Days of Python** course by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agICnT8t4iYVSZ3eykIAOME).  
This repository contains all the code, notes, and progress tracking as I complete each day of the challenge.

## 📌 Goal

Although it's called **100 Days of Python**, I'm speeding it up and aim to finish it in just a few focused days!  
This repo is a personal log to track my progress and reinforce my learning.
